Outperforming the markets through active investment strategies is one of the main challenges in finance.
The random movements of assets and the unpredictability of catalysts make it hard to perform better than the average market, therefore, in such a competitive environment, the methods designed to keep low transaction costs have a significant impact on the obtained wealth.
This thesis focuses on investing techniques to beat market returns through Online Portfolio Optimization while controlling transaction costs.
Such a framework differs from classical approaches as it assumes that the market has an adversarial behavior and no statistical characterization is assumed, requiring frequent rebalancing of the portfolio.
Within this context, most of the existing algorithms neglect transaction costs; we show that the one which provides bounded costs make unrealistic assumptions.
To deal with transaction costs, in the Online Portfolio Optimization setting, we propose the use of the Online Gradient Descent algorithm. We show that it has regret, considering costs, of the order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, $T$ being the investment horizon, and has $\Theta(N)$ per-step computational complexity, $N$ being the number of assets.
Furthermore, we show that this algorithm provides competitive gains when compared empirically with state-of-the-art online learning algorithms on real-world datasets.
